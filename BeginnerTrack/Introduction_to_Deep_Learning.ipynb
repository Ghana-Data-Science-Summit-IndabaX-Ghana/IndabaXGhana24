Input Embeddings**\n\nThis cell initializes the embedding layer that converts tokenized input into dense numerical vectors. Embeddings capture semantic relationships between tokens and are crucial for the Transformer model to understand the meaning of words in the input sequence.\n\nAn embedding layer is essentially a lookup table where each word in the vocabulary is mapped to a vector of fixed size (embedding dimension). These vectors are learned during training and represent words in a continuous vector space. By the end of training, words with similar meanings have similar vector representations. \n\nIn the context of natural language processing, vectors are mathematical representations of words. Each word is represented by a point in a high-dimensional space. The dimensions can be thought of as features that capture different aspects of the word's meaning. \n\nFor example, in a 3-dimensional space, a word like \"king\" might be represented by a vector (0.5, 0.2, 0.7). These vectors allow us to perform mathematical operations to understand word relationships. One common operation is calculating the cosine similarity between two vectors to measure how similar they are. Cosine similarity is the cosine of the angle between two vectors, with values ranging from -1 (completely opposite) to 1 (exactly the same).","metadata":{"_uuid":"8067d30a-a92e-4326-8ffc-db34256eefc4","_cell_guid":"468082ac-473e-430b-aef8-d752b3fd8494","id":"SppqCbVkwUvs","trusted":true}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class InputEmbedding(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, embed_dim: int, vocab_size: int):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize the InputEmbedding module.\n\n        Args:\n            embed_dim (int): The dimensionality of the input embedding.\n            vocab_size (int): The size of the vocabulary.\n\n        \"\"\"\n        super().__init__()\n        # Store the dimensionality and vocabulary size\n        self.embed_dim = embed_dim\n        self.vocab_size = vocab_size\n\n        # Create an embedding layer that maps the vocabulary to an embed_dim-dimensional space\n        # The embedding layer should have shape (vocab_size, embed_dim)\n        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embed_dim)\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        \"\"\"\n        Perform the forward pass of the InputEmbedding module.\n\n        Args:\n            x (tensor): The input tensor.\n\n        Returns:\n            tensor: The embedded input tensor after scaling it by the square root of the dimensionality.\n\n        \"\"\"\n        # Embed the input tensor using the embedding layer\n        # Shape: (batch_size, seq_len) -> (batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim)\n        embedded_input = self.embedding(x)\n        # Scale the embedded input tensor by the square root of the dimensionality\n        # Shape: (batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim) -> (batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim)\n        scaled_embedded_input = embedded_input * torch.sqrt(torch.tensor(self.embed_dim))\n        return scaled_embedded_input","metadata":{"_uuid":"c09631bb-64a9-4e68-916a-832ed9c53f33","_cell_guid":"afc3c357-5273-4b69-a550-8f11454aab08","collapsed":false,"id":"CO1r2FtaoRCB","jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**2.

This parallel processing does not inherently capture the order of tokens. Positional encoding addresses this by adding a unique positional signal to each token, allowing the Transformer to differentiate between tokens at different positions.\n\nThe positional encoding is calculated using sine and cosine functions of different frequencies.

Multi-Head Attention Block**\n\nImplements multi-head attention, which allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. This mechanism enhances the model's ability to capture dependencies and relationships in the input data.\n\nAttention mechanisms allow models to focus on specific parts of the input sequence, giving more importance to certain words or tokens. Multi-head attention extends this idea by having multiple attention heads, each attending to different parts of the sequence independently. The results from each head are then concatenated and linearly transformed.\n\nHere's how it works in detail:\n- **Query, Key, Value (QKV) Transformations**: For each attention head, we have three learned matrices: query (Q), key (K), and value (V). These matrices transform the input into query, key, and value vectors.\n- **Attention Scores**: The attention score is calculated by taking the dot product of the query and key vectors, scaled by the square root of the dimension of the key vectors. This is followed by a softmax operation to obtain the attention weights.\n- **Weighted Sum**: The attention weights are used to compute a weighted sum of the value vectors.\n- **Concatenation and Projection**: The outputs of all the heads are concatenated and projected back to the original dimension.","metadata":{"_uuid":"754921a8-91f2-4558-94f0-eb191fac452f","_cell_guid":"4c54021b-232a-4b80-96d2-5c57b18af6ce","id":"8LODeG5Clvni","trusted":true}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class MultiHeadAttention(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, embed_dim: int = 512, num_heads: int = 8, attn_dropout: float = 0.1, ff_dropout: float = 0.1, max_len: int = 512):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.num_heads = num_heads\n        assert embed_dim % self.num_heads == 0, \"invalid heads and embedding dimension configuration\"\n        self.query = nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim)\n        self.key = nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim)\n        self.value = nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim)\n        self.proj = nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim)\n        self.attn_dropout = nn.Dropout(attn_dropout)\n        self.proj_dropout = nn.Dropout(ff_dropout)\n\n    def forward(self, x, mask=None):\n        batch_size, seq_len, _ = x.size()\n        # Apply linear transformations to the input tensor\n        # Take input tensor and apply linear transformation,\n        # then split the tensor into num_heads and head_dim\n        # transpose the tensor into correct order\n        # Shape: (batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim) -> (batch_size, seq_len, num_heads, head_dim) ->\n        # (batch_size, seq_len, num_heads, head_dim) -> (batch_size, num_heads, seq_len, head_dim)\n        q = self.query(x).view(batch_size, seq_len, self.num_heads, -1).transpose(1, 2)\n        k = self.key(x).view(batch_size, seq_len, self.num_heads, -1).transpose(1, 2)\n        v = self.value(x).view(batch_size, seq_len, self.num_heads, -1).transpose(1, 2)\n\n        # Compute attention scores using Einsum\n        # b: batch size, h: num_heads, i: seq_len, j: seq_len, d: head_dim\n        # Multiply query and key tensors element-wise and sum along the shared dimension (head_dim)\n        # Divide by the square root of the dimension of the query/key vectors\n        # Equivalent to: attention = torch.matmul(q, k.transpose(-2, -1)) / math.sqrt(q.size(-1))\n        # Shape: (batch_size, num_heads, seq_len, head_dim) * (batch_size, num_heads, seq_len, head_dim)\n        # -> (batch_size, num_heads, seq_len, seq_len)\n        attention = torch.einsum('bhid,bhjd->bhij', q, k) / math.sqrt(q.size(-1))\n\n        # Apply mask if provided\n        if mask is not None:\n            attention = attention.masked_fill(mask == 0, float(\"-inf\"))\n\n        # Apply softmax and dropout\n        # Shape: (batch_size, num_heads, seq_len, seq_len) -> (batch_size, num_heads, seq_len, head_dim)\n        attention = self.attn_dropout(F.softmax(attention, dim=-1))\n\n        # Compute the weighted sum of values using attention scores\n        # Equivalent to: torch.matmul(attention, v)\n        # Shape: (batch_size, num_heads, seq_len, seq_len) * (batch_size, num_heads, seq_len, head_dim)\n        # -> (batch_size, num_heads, seq_len, head_dim)\n        y = torch.einsum('bhij,bhjd->bhid', attention, v)\n\n        # Merge the num_heads and head_dim back to the embed_dim\n        # Transpose sequence length and num_heads\n        # Flatten out the full tensor\n        # Reshape based on batch size, sequence length and embed_dim\n        # Shape: (batch_size, num_heads, seq_len, head_dim) -> (batch_size, seq_len, num_heads, head_dim)\n        # -> (batch_size, seq_len, num_heads * head_dim)\n        # -> (batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim)\n        y = y.transpose(1, 2).contiguous().view(batch_size, seq_len, -1)\n\n        # Apply linear transformation and dropout\n        # Shape: (batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim) -> (batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim)\n        return self.proj_dropout(self.proj(y))","metadata":{"_uuid":"82947d60-607a-45e9-87bd-557e20b64c46","_cell_guid":"62ae2416-c110-4cf8-8d7a-77c78fa3cb63","collapsed":false,"id":"Y1QgdrDKouit","jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**6.

To prevent this, we use a mask that blocks future positions. This is called a \"causal\" or \"look-ahead\" mask.\n\nThe `generate_square_subsequent_mask` function creates such a mask. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the function and its implementation:\n\n### Function Explanation\n\n**Purpose**: \nThe function generates a square mask for a sequence of a given size. This mask is used to ensure that each position in the sequence can only attend to the positions before it (and itself), and not the positions that come after it. \n\n**Arguments**:\n- `size` (int): The size of the square mask. This is typically the length of the sequence.\n- `device` (torch.device): The device on which the mask is created (e.g., CPU or GPU).\n\n**Returns**:\n- `torch.Tensor`: A mask tensor of shape `(size, size)`, where positions that should be masked are filled with `float('-inf')`, and unmasked positions are filled with `float(0.0)`.\n\n### Code Explanation\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n    ```python\n    mask = torch.triu(torch.ones(size, size, device=device) * float('-inf'), diagonal=1)\n    ```\n    - `torch.ones(size, size, device=device)`: Creates a tensor of shape `(size, size)` filled with ones on the specified device.\n    - `* float('-inf')`: Multiplies all the ones by negative infinity (`-inf`), resulting in a tensor filled with `-inf`.\n    - `torch.triu(..., diagonal=1)`: Extracts the upper triangular part of the tensor, starting from the first diagonal above the main diagonal (hence `diagonal=1`). This effectively sets all elements above the main diagonal to `-inf` and keeps the lower triangle (including the main diagonal) as zeros.\n\n2. **Return Mask**:\n    ```python\n    return mask\n    ```\n    - The function returns the generated mask.\n\n# Example usage\nsize = 5\nmask = generate_square_subsequent_mask(size)\nprint(mask)\n```\n\n### Example Output\n\nFor `size = 5`, the generated mask will look like this:\n\n```\ntensor([[  0., -inf, -inf, -inf, -inf],\n        [  0.,   0., -inf, -inf, -inf],\n        [  0.,   0.,   0., -inf, -inf],\n        [  0.,   0.,   0.,   0., -inf],\n        [  0.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0.]])\n```\n\nThis mask ensures that each position can only attend to itself and the positions before it, effectively preventing any position from attending to future positions during sequence generation.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def generate_square_subsequent_mask(size, device='cpu'):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate a square mask for the sequence.

Training a neural network involves multiple epochs, where in each epoch the model sees the entire training dataset once. During each epoch, the dataset is divided into batches to efficiently utilize memory and speed up computations. Here’s a detailed explanation of what each part of the code does:\n\n1. **Moving Model to Device**:\n   The model is moved to the specified device (CPU or GPU). Training on a GPU can significantly speed up the process compared to a CPU.\n\n2. **Setting Up Optimizer and Loss Function**:\n   - **Optimizer**: The Adam optimizer is used, which is an adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm that's popular for training deep learning models. It adjusts the learning rate for each parameter dynamically.\n   - **Loss Function**: CrossEntropyLoss is used, which is suitable for classification tasks. It combines LogSoftmax and NLLLoss in one single class, which is useful when training a language model.\n\n3. **Preparing DataLoader**:\n   The DataLoader is used to efficiently handle the dataset during training. It allows us to iterate over the dataset in mini-batches, shuffle the data, and load the data in parallel using multiple workers.\n\n4. **Training Loop**:\n   The loop runs for a specified number of epochs. Each epoch involves one complete pass through the training dataset.\n\n5. **Setting Model to Training Mode**:\n   The model is set to training mode. Certain layers, like dropout, behave differently during training and evaluation, so it's important to set the correct mode.\n\n6. **Initializing Total Loss**:\n   `total_loss` is initialized to accumulate the loss over all batches in the epoch.\n\n7. **Iterating Over Batches**:\n   We iterate over each batch in the DataLoader. Each batch contains a subset of the training data.\n\n8. **Zeroing Gradients**:\n   Before the backward pass, all the gradients for the variables are zeroed. This is important because PyTorch accumulates the gradients on subsequent backward passes.\n\n9. **Unpacking and Moving Data to Device**:\n   The input data and labels are unpacked from the batch and moved to the specified device.\n\n10. **Generating Causal Mask**:\n    A causal mask is generated for the sequence to ensure that each position can only attend to the positions before it (and itself), preventing information leakage from future tokens.\n\n11. **Forward Pass**:\n    A forward pass is performed through the model to obtain the logits (raw predictions before applying softmax).\n\n12. **Flattening Logits and Labels**:\n    The logits and labels are flattened to compute the loss. This is necessary because CrossEntropyLoss expects the inputs to be of shape (N, C) where N is the number of examples and C is the number of classes.\n\n13. **Computing Loss**:\n    The loss between the predicted logits and the true labels is computed using the cross-entropy loss function.\n\n14. **Backward Pass**:\n    A backward pass is performed to compute the gradients of the loss with respect to the model parameters.\n\n15. **Optimizer Step**:\n    The model parameters are updated using the gradients computed during the backward pass.\n\n16. **Accumulating Loss**:\n    The loss is accumulated over all batches to keep track of the total loss for the epoch.\n\n17. **Logging Loss**:\n    At the end of each epoch, the average loss over all batches is printed to monitor the training progress.\n\n### Additional Debugging Lines (Commented Out):\n\n- **Inspecting Input Data and Labels**:\n    These lines are useful for debugging to check if the input data and labels are correctly loaded.\n\n- **Inspecting Logits**:\n    This line helps in inspecting the raw model outputs (logits) to ensure that the model is functioning correctly.\n\n- **Checking for NaN or Inf in Loss**:\n    These lines are useful for checking if the loss contains any NaN or infinite values, which can indicate issues in the training process.\n\n- **Checking for NaN or Inf in Gradients**:\n    These lines check if the gradients contain NaN or infinite values, which can also indicate problems in the training process.\n\nBy following these steps, we train our Transformer model over multiple epochs, updating the model parameters to minimize the loss and improve performance on the training dataset.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"model.to(device)\noptimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=lr)\ncriterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()\ntrain_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True,)\n\nfor epoch in range(num_epochs):\n    model.train()\n    total_loss = 0.0\n\n    for batch in train_loader:\n        optimizer.zero_grad()\n        # Unpack input and label from the batch and send them to the device\n        input_ids, labels = batch\n        input_ids, labels = input_ids.to(device), labels.to(device)\n\n        # Print input data and labels to inspect\n        # print(f\"Input IDs: {input_ids}\")\n        # print(f\"Labels: {labels}\")\n\n        # Generate the causal mask\n        # Shape: (batch_size, seq_len, seq_len)\n        mask = generate_square_subsequent_mask(input_ids.size(1), device=device)\n\n        # Forward pass\n        logits = model(input_ids=input_ids, attention_mask=mask)\n\n        # Print logits to inspect\n        # print(f\"Logits: {logits}\")\n\n        # Flatten the logits and labels for computing the loss\n        logits_flat = logits.view(-1, logits.size(-1))\n        labels_flat = labels.view(-1)\n\n        # Compute the loss\n        loss = criterion(logits_flat, labels_flat)\n\n        # Check for NaN or Inf values in loss\n        # if torch.isnan(loss) or torch.isinf(loss):\n        #     print(f\"NaN or Inf detected in loss at epoch {epoch}\")\n        #     continue\n\n        # Backward pass and optimization step\n        loss.backward()\n\n        # Check for NaN or Inf values in gradients\n        # for name, param in model.named_parameters():\n        #     if param.grad is not None and (torch.isnan(param.grad).any() or torch.isinf(param.grad).any()):\n        #         print(f\"NaN or Inf detected in gradients at epoch {epoch} for parameter {name}\")\n        #         continue\n\n        optimizer.step()\n\n        total_loss += loss.item()\n\n    print(f'Epoch {epoch+1}/{num_epochs}, Loss: {total_loss/len(train_loader)}')","metadata":{"_uuid":"d9e600b4-da71-4d30-8629-ae918d4c11a5","_cell_guid":"70a8bba2-c549-4f3a-8236-f2d8205ddeec","collapsed":false,"id":"lHwFX_z9pcJu","outputId":"11006cd9-be81-4685-aa7c-d02f4a3fc799","jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**12.

This ensures that sequences are padded correctly to a uniform length.\n\n4. **Tokenizing the Data**:\n   - `inputs = tokenizer(sample_data, return_tensors='pt', max_length=128, padding='max_length', truncation=True)`: Tokenizes the sample data, converts it to PyTorch tensors, and ensures all sequences are padded or truncated to a maximum length of 128 tokens.\n\n5. **Creating TensorDataset**:\n   - `input_ids = inputs['input_ids']`: Extracts the input IDs (tokenized data) from the tokenized inputs.\n   - `labels = inputs['input_ids']`: Sets the labels to be the same as the input IDs for language modeling tasks, where the model tries to predict the next token in the sequence.\n   - `train_dataset = TensorDataset(input_ids, labels)`: Creates a TensorDataset from the input IDs and labels, which will be used to create a DataLoader.\n\n6. **Creating DataLoader**:\n   - `train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=2, shuffle=True)`: Creates a DataLoader from the TensorDataset, specifying a batch size of 2 and shuffling the data at the beginning of each epoch to ensure the model sees the data in a different order each time.\n\nThis setup is crucial for efficiently feeding data into the model during training, ensuring that the data is properly tokenized, padded, and batched.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import torch\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset\n\n# Tokenizer and model\nmodel_name = \"gpt2\"\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)\n\nif tokenizer.pad_token is None:\n    tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token\n\n# Tokenize the data\ninputs = tokenizer(sample_data, return_tensors='pt', max_length=128, padding='max_length', truncation=True)\n\n# Create TensorDataset\ninput_ids = inputs['input_ids']\nlabels = inputs['input_ids']  # In this case, labels are the same as input_ids for language modeling\n\n# Create DataLoader\ntrain_dataset = TensorDataset(input_ids, labels)\ntrain_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=2, shuffle=True)","metadata":{"_uuid":"6110391c-a629-4240-80f5-01d253ab27b2","_cell_guid":"cb12c825-6d3c-4e86-977c-54a05c36db25","collapsed":false,"id":"LRlzrDFtp5D8","jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"1. **Sample Input Text**:\n   - `input_txt = \"Building Deep Neural Networks with PyTorch\"`: Defines the sample text that you want to tokenize and process.

Logits are the raw, unnormalized predictions of the model.\n   - `next_token_logits = logits[0, -1, :]`: Selects the logits corresponding to the last token in the sequence.\n   - `next_token_probs = torch.softmax(next_token_logits, dim=-1)`: Applies the softmax function to the logits to convert them into probabilities.\n   - `sorted_ids = torch.argsort(next_token_probs, dim=-1, descending=True)`: Sorts the token probabilities in descending order to get the most likely next tokens.\n\n6. **Storing Top Token Choices**:\n   - Loops over the top token choices to store their probabilities and decoded text representations in the `iteration` dictionary.\n   - `iterations.append(iteration)`: Appends the current iteration’s results to the `iterations` list.\n\n7. **Appending Predicted Token to Input**:\n   - `input_ids = torch.cat([input_ids, sorted_ids[None, 0, None]], dim=-1)`: Appends the most likely next token to the input sequence for the next iteration.\n\n8. **Creating DataFrame for Analysis**:\n   - `sample_inference = pd.DataFrame(iterations)`: Converts the `iterations` list into a pandas DataFrame for easier analysis and visualization.\n   - `sample_inference.head()`: Displays the first few rows of the DataFrame to inspect the results.\n\nThis simply shows how to generate text using a pre-trained language model by iteratively predicting and appending new tokens to the input sequence. The use of softmax ensures that the model’s predictions are probabilistic, allowing for more controlled and interpretable text generation.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"model = model.to(device)\niterations = []\nn_steps = 10\nchoices_per_step = 5\n\nwith torch.no_grad():\n    for _ in range(n_steps):\n        iteration = dict()\n        iteration[\"Input\"] = tokenizer.decode(input_ids[0])\n        output = model(input_ids=input_ids)\n\n        # Extract the logits from the output\n        logits = output.logits\n\n        # Select logits of the first batch and the last token and apply softmax to get the probability\n        next_token_logits = logits[0, -1, :]\n        next_token_probs = torch.softmax(next_token_logits, dim=-1)\n        sorted_ids = torch.argsort(next_token_probs, dim=-1, descending=True)\n\n        # Store tokens with highest probabilities in our little table\n        for choice_idx in range(choices_per_step):\n            token_id = sorted_ids[choice_idx]\n            token_prob = next_token_probs[token_id].cpu().numpy()\n            token_choice = (\n                f\"{tokenizer.decode(token_id)} ({100 * token_prob:.2f}%)\"\n            )\n            iteration[f\"Choice {choice_idx+1}\"] = token_choice\n        iterations.append(iteration)\n\n        # Append predicted next token to input\n        input_ids = torch.cat([input_ids, sorted_ids[None, 0, None]], dim=-1)\n\nsample_inference = pd.DataFrame(iterations)\nsample_inference.head()\n","metadata":{"_uuid":"15e96dbb-e7d6-4b78-84b6-84da2b164387","_cell_guid":"0e870499-a8c5-4d30-84f1-dd2c0e99c668","collapsed":false,"id":"zemsMWd4qDX3","outputId":"85ec5ba4-a0fb-4364-a0da-6900b2a7192a","jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Function Parameters:\n- `input_text` (str): The initial input text to start the generation process.\n- `model`: The pre-trained language model used for text generation.\n- `tokenizer`: The tokenizer corresponding to the model, used to convert text to token IDs and vice versa.\n- `max_length` (int): The maximum length of the generated text.
